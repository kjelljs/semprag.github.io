# Frontmatter (the preamble)

Instructions for the content that comes before `\begin{document}`.

## Metadata

The `\pdf*{}` commands control the metadata inserted into the published PDF.
Only ASCII characters are allowed in these fields, otherwise the `pdflatex` compiler will throw very hard to debug errors.

## Title

The `\title{}` can contain a `\thanks{}` acknowledgements section. If you do not give `\title[Something Short]{Full}` the optional argument (here, "Something Short"), no title will be shown in the headers of subsequent pages. If your title is shorter than 30 characters, use the same title for each.

## Authors

There is no limit to the number of authors you can have. Each use of `\spauthor{}` should be separated by `\AND`.

The optional argument to `\author` (inside square brackets) is what appears in the header on subsequent pages. Just give your full name. For two authors, you can give both full names conjoined with *and*. When the author list becomes too long, use last names only, and use *&* instead of *and*. If you have more than three authors, use "Murphy et al." (where Murphy is the last name of the first author).

## Keywords

The content of the `keywords` environment should be the same as the `\pdfkeywords{}` command, except that the environment allows an extended character set. Six is a good target for number of keywords.

# The document

## Examples

You are free to use any package you wish for numbering examples.

However, we impose a few general formatting restrictions:

- Example numbers appear in round parentheses, left-aligned.
- Subexamples are labeled with lowercase alphabetical letters, each followed by a period.
- Equations and examples should be numbered in the same sequence.
- References to examples appear inside parentheses, with no punctuation between elements.
  - E.g., we can refer to (12), or to its subexample (12a).

We have found that the [linguex package](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/linguex) works well with our styles. You can load it by simply passing a `linguex` option to `sp.cls`.

For more complex needs (complex glosses, for example), we recommend the [expex package](http://ctan.org/pkg/expex). We expect to offer full expex integration into our system soon.

## BibTeX and Citations

The `sp.cls` style file adds a few commands to the standard `natbib` commands. The `sb.bst` file will handle most details about how your `.bib` file is rendered, but here are a few things to keep in mind.

There are four main citation forms:

- `\citealt{montague:1974}`: Montague 1974
  - This refers to the work.
- `\citet{montague:1974}`: Montague (1974)
  - This refers to the author in the context of this work.
- `\citep{montague:1974}`: (Montague 1974)
  - This refers parenthetically to this work.
- `\citeauthor{montague:1974}`: Montague
  - Useful if you recently used `\citet{montague:1974}` and it's clear you're talking about the same work.

The S&P file also supports the following commands:

- `\pgcitealt{montague:1974}{12}`: Montague 1974: 12
- `\pgcitet{montague:1974}{12}`: Montague (1974: 12)
- `\pgcitep{montague:1974}{12}`: (Montague 1974: 12)
- `\seccitet{montague:1974}{2}`: Montague (1974: ยง2)
- `\posscitet{montague:1974}`: Montague's (1974)
- `\pgposscitet{montague:1974}{12}`: Montague's (1974: 12)
- `\posscitet{montague:1974}`: Montague's (1974)
- `\possciteauthor{montague:1974}`: Montague's
- `\secposscitet{montague:1974}{2}`: Montague's (1974: ยง2)
- `\seccitealt{montague:1974}{2}`: Montague 1974: ยง2
- `\seccitep{montague:1974}{2}`: (Montague 1974: ยง2)

Every reference to an article must be coded with one of these commands.
This ensures that all bibliographic entries are included, and, since these automatically hyperlink to the corresponding entry in the bibliography, allows your readers to determine what work you are referring to.

## Images and custom figures

You can easily include a range of figures using the `\includegraphics{}` command.

    \includegraphics[width=4in]{figure-1b.pdf}
    \includegraphics[height=1in]{my-pet-cat.png}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{image-file.jpg}

N.B. `\includegraphics` prefers filenames without underscores.

## Floats, for figures and tables

The `sp.cls` includes the `float` package by default.
If you need to modify the S&P `float` configuration temporarily, you can:

    % outside brackets ensure that the style returns to normal
    % after the temporary adjustment
    {
      \floatstyle{plain}
      % See the `float` documentation for other styles.
      \restylefloat{figure}
      \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics{some-carefully-named.pdf}
        Your figure goes here.
      \end{figure}
    }

# Backmatter

The end sections are organized in this order:

1. Appendix
2. References
3. Addresses

## Appendix

The `appendix` environment, is a good home for lengthy proofs, fragments, experimental materials, etc.

    \begin{appendix}
      ...
    \end{appendix}

## References

Simply use the following, where you have a file `your-references.bib` in the same folder.

    \bibliography{your-references}

If you have a system-wide BibTeX file somewhere else that's accessible to your LaTeX library, that is fine too.
However, when submitting your article, you will need to include whatever `.bib` file you use here.

## Addresses

Full author addresses appear at the end of each article.
They are specified in an `addresses` environment, which consists of `address` environments:

    \begin{addresses}
      \begin{address}
        Author1 \\
        Street \\
        ... \\
        \email{author1@email.edu}
      \end{address}
      \begin{address}
        Author2 \\
        Street \\
        ... \\
        \email{author2@email.edu}
      \end{address}
      % repeat if needed
    \end{addresses}

## BibTeX

The `.bib` file's BibTeX format allows leaving our certain fields in each entry's specification. We require a great deal more specificity to meet *S&P* publication standards.

- Journal articles should specify both volume and issue.
- Books should have publisher and address (city) information.
- Journal and book titles *must* be given in full, with the initial letter of each major word capitalized.
- Articles in journals and books *must* specify page numbers.
- Use full first names of authors or editors.
- In case of multiple authorship, the names of all authors must be given.
- Unpublished manuscripts need a month and year. If a url is available, include it.
- For all urls, we prefer a url to a permanent resource such as SemanticsArchive, rather than the author's homepage or institutional website, but if the latter is the only available option, please use it.
- Conference proceedings should *not* include editor information. They should be given the `@article` type with the `journal` field set to the conference name and the acronym in parentheses: `journal = {North East Linguistic Society ({NELS})}`. Do not include the words "proceedings of the" or "papers from the".
- Publishers that have multiple cities should include both (unless the publisher information indicates otherwise). Conjoin them with an ampersand `\&`.
- Do not hard-case words or letters in your BibTeX entries (e.g., `{B}ook {T}itle`), except for the following exceptions:
  - Proper names
    - Languages
    - People
    - Places
  - Acronyms
  - All nouns if the title is in German or similar languages that capitalize nouns
  - Even in these cases, hard-case the entire word instead of the initial letter. (This is essential for proper kerning.)
    - <del>`{B}ook`</del> `{Book}`
- Whenever possible, include the DOI for the article. These are often hard to find, but [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) and [crossref.org/SimpleTextQuery](http://crossref.org/SimpleTextQuery/) can help.
  - DOIs should never end in periods, which can cause the DOI lookup to fail.
