Dear X (if I may!),

I would like to invite you to join the Editorial Board of Semantics and Pragmatics (http://semprag.org/, aka S&P). S&P is now one of the two full journals of the LSA, alongside Language. Our Editorial Board members can expect to be asked for reviews no more than twice a year, and it is no problem if you decline reviews, provided you are able to let us know in a reasonably timely fashion. The reviews we look for are short and to the point and fast (our normal time frame is four weeks from the date of the request), since one of our goals is to bring journal turnaround times in Linguistics up to standards that are considered normal in much of the scientific community.

We think that you belong on our Editorial Board --- indeed, it was an oversight that we had not invited you previously. If you agree to join our board, please let us know. We will then create a login on the journal's website for you, if you don't already have one. When you get the chance, we would be grateful if you would fill out your profile on the website (in particular your reviewing interests).

Let me mention right away that we have a paper under submission that you would be an excellent reviewer for. So, if you join us, please expect a review request very soon. (But your invitation to the board is in no way conditioned on your saying yes to this particular review request!)

Best,

Y (for the rest of the editorial team)
